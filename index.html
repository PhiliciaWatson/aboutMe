        <h1>This girl Educated</h1>
        Guess I'll start with my educational history. So, I graduated highschool the year of 2020 then after that I attended the Kable Academy <!--put more info here--> , TWICE, so I can begin the path to a better and more financially stable career pathway and, hopefully, it will assist me in my path of becoming a game designer. I know it sounds silly and childish but the though of creating games just... gets me ENTHUSIASTIC!

       <h1>A heart of Gold</h1>
        Next, I'll talk about my values. I myself very much value family and friends I say without them I wouldn't be the person I am now. I also enjoy culture and the different ways of how others live on a day to day basis or celebrations , hoildays, and others cultural values. Last but not least is nature and animals, I very much careful about the wellbeing of wild animals and the planet, especially, due to its current state.
